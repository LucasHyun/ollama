Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our planet, it encounters the tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n2. **Scattering occurs**: These gas molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n3. **Blue light is scattered in all directions**: As a result of this scattering, blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from every direction.\n4. **Our eyes see the blue light**: When we look up at the sky, our eyes detect the blue light that has been scattered by the gas molecules, giving the sky its blue appearance.\n\nThe reason why the sky isn't always blue (e.g., during sunrise or sunset) is because the shorter wavelengths of light are mostly absent from these times. At sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays have to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere, which scatters the shorter wavelengths even more, leaving mainly longer wavelengths (reds and oranges) to reach our eyes.\n\nAdditionally, atmospheric conditions such as dust, pollution, and water vapor can also affect the color of the sky. For example, during severe thunderstorms or dust storms, the sky may appear more gray or brown due to the increased amount of particles in the atmosphere.\n\nIn summary, the blue color of the sky is a result of the scattering of sunlight by gas molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths (blue) being scattered more than longer wavelengths (red).","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[128006,9125,128007,271,38766,1303,33025,2696,25,6790,220,2366,18,271,128009,128006,882,128007,271,10445,374,279,13180,6437,30,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,791,13180,8111,6437,1606,315,264,25885,2663,72916,11,902,13980,994,40120,84261,449,279,13987,35715,315,45612,304,279,9420,596,16975,13,5810,596,264,44899,16540,1473,16,13,3146,31192,4238,29933,279,9420,596,16975,96618,3277,40120,29933,1057,11841,11,433,35006,279,13987,35715,315,45612,1778,439,47503,320,45,17,8,323,24463,320,46,17,4390,17,13,3146,3407,31436,13980,96618,4314,6962,35715,45577,279,3177,304,682,18445,11,719,814,45577,24210,320,12481,8,93959,810,1109,5129,320,1171,8,93959,13,1115,374,3967,439,13558,64069,72916,627,18,13,3146,10544,3177,374,38067,304,682,18445,96618,1666,264,1121,315,420,72916,11,6437,3177,374,77810,6957,279,16975,11,19261,1057,6548,505,1475,5216,627,19,13,3146,8140,6548,1518,279,6437,3177,96618,3277,584,1427,709,520,279,13180,11,1057,6548,11388,279,6437,3177,430,706,1027,38067,555,279,6962,35715,11,7231,279,13180,1202,6437,11341,382,791,2944,3249,279,13180,4536,956,2744,6437,320,68,1326,2637,2391,64919,477,44084,8,374,1606,279,24210,93959,315,3177,527,10213,28310,505,1521,3115,13,2468,64919,323,44084,11,279,7160,596,45220,617,311,5944,1555,810,315,279,9420,596,16975,11,902,1156,10385,279,24210,93959,1524,810,11,9564,14918,5129,93959,320,54469,323,85138,8,311,5662,1057,6548,382,50674,11,45475,4787,1778,439,16174,11,25793,11,323,3090,38752,649,1101,7958,279,1933,315,279,13180,13,1789,3187,11,2391,15748,37943,83109,477,16174,44583,11,279,13180,1253,5101,810,18004,477,14198,4245,311,279,7319,3392,315,19252,304,279,16975,382,644,12399,11,279,6437,1933,315,279,13180,374,264,1121,315,279,72916,315,40120,555,6962,35715,304,279,9420,596,16975,11,449,24210,93959,320,12481,8,1694,38067,810,1109,5129,93959,320,1171,570],"total_duration":10239405125,"load_duration":575699666,"prompt_eval_count":31,"prompt_eval_duration":2578000000,"eval_count":354,"eval_duration":7083000000}
